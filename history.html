      <p>
        Version Control Systems (VCS) have evolved significantly over the years. Below are some key milestones in the history of VCS tools:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>RCS (Revision Control System)</strong> - Introduced in the 1980s, it was one of the first tools for managing changes to files.</li>
        <li><strong>CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</strong> - Developed in the late 1980s, it allowed multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong> - Released in 2000, it aimed to be a better CVS, providing improved features and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Git</strong> - Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, it introduced a distributed model that revolutionized how developers collaborate.</li>
        <li><strong>Mercurial</strong> - Released in 2005, it is another distributed VCS that emphasizes simplicity and performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The introduction of distributed VCS like Git and Mercurial changed the game by allowing for better branching and merging models, enabling developers to work more efficiently and collaboratively.
